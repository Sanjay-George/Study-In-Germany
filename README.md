## Find the courses / universities
* Search programmes at [DAAD](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/result/)
* Add relevant filters - Course Type, Field of Study, Course Language, etc.
* For each programme, visit the university's website to understand the important details such as:
1. Deadlines (application, enrolment)
2. Application criteria (IELTS, LOR etc)
3. Uni assist
4. Start of semester
5. Course modules and duration
6. About the City (Cost of living, part time jobs)


**Tip:** Initially, create a list of universities or programmes you like. Then go through them again and shorten it based on your interest. Do 2-3 rounds of shortlisting and then prepare for the requirements of those courses.

**Note:** Some programmes have no tuition fees, but only semester fees (approx Euro 300 per sem). Some courses need LORs from your previous uni or work place, so check if this is feasible for you.


## Apply to student dorms
* Google Studentenwerk \<cityName\> and apply for a room as early as possible. 

**Tip:** Getting an accommodation is extremely difficult in certain cities, the wait times could be as long as 2 semesters (a year!). Better to apply early and cancel later if you aren't goinig there.

[You can find websites to search for private accommodation here](TODO) 
  
## Prepare for GRE
**Note:** GRE isn't generally required at most German Universities. However, there are some unis that consider GRE score supplemental to your Degree grades. So if you have a lower grade, a good GRE score could improve your chance of getting accepted. Do this only if the university's website states that they consider GRE Scores.  

## Prepare for English Language Test
English-taught programmes need IELTS / TOEFL as Language certificate. The university website will detail the requirement. Generally you'll need to score higher than **CEFR level B2**

## Formulate Statement of Purpose
SOP is extremely crucial to the admission process. It could decide whether you make into the programme or not. And since it's a subjective requirement, do spend a lot of time refining your SOP. You can refer the following links to get the idea on how to write an SOP

3. [DAAD - advice for motivation letter](https://www2.daad.de/medien/deutschland/stipendien/formulare/advice-for-motivation-letter.pdf)

**Tip:** Get your SOP reviewed on Reddit. There's a [subreddit for just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/StatementOfPurpose/)

## Apply to Universities ahead of deadlines
Deadlines are important! So get your documents ready and apply way before the last date.

There are basically 2 ways that universities accept applications:
1. **Direct Application:** This differs from uni to uni, so follow the instructions on their website. Most probably you'll need to send physical documents to the university (probably even notarized).
2. **Through Uni-Assist:** This is easy! [Uni Assist](https://my.uni-assist.de/) is an intermediary and makes the application process easier. With uni-assist, we only need to send the documents once, and uni assist will verify and forward them to all universities that accept applications through uni-assist. You can read the [checklist here](https://www.uni-assist.de/tools/checklisten/)

**Tip:** If you use DHL for sending your documents, ask them about any student offer or discount. 

**Note:** Any application that is forwarded through uni-assist needs to reach uni-assist by the deadline mentioned in university website. **Eg:** If the deadline is 31 October, your hard copies need to reach uni assist by that date.
