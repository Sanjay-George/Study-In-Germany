## Find the courses / universities üîç
* Search programmes at [DAAD](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/result/)
* Add relevant filters - Course Type, Field of Study, Course Language, etc.
* For each programme, visit the university's website to understand the important details such as:
1. Deadlines (application, enrolment)
2. Application criteria (IELTS, LOR etc)
3. Uni assist
4. Start of semester
5. Course modules and duration
6. About the City (Cost of living, part time jobs)


**Tip:** Initially, create a list of universities or programmes you like. Then go through them again and shorten it based on your interest. Do 2-3 rounds of shortlisting and then prepare for the requirements of those courses.

**Note:** Some programmes have no tuition fees, but only semester fees (approx Euro 300 per sem). Some courses need LORs from your previous uni or work place, so check if this is feasible for you.


## Apply to student dorms üõñ
* Google Studentenwerk \<cityName\> and apply for a room as early as possible. 

**Tip:** Getting an accommodation is extremely difficult in certain cities, the wait times could be as long as 2 semesters (a year!). Better to apply early and cancel later if you aren't goinig there.

Here are some of the websites to search for **private accommodations**:
1. [Ebay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/)
2. [WG Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/)

**Google these keywords:** 'wg <cityname>', 'zimmer <cityname>', 'wohnung in <cityname>', etc.
  
## Prepare for GRE üìï
**Note:** GRE isn't generally required at most German Universities. However, there are some unis that consider GRE score supplemental to your Degree grades. So if you have a lower grade, a good GRE score could improve your chance of getting accepted. Do this only if the university's website states that they consider GRE Scores.  

## Prepare for English Language Test üìó
English-taught programmes need IELTS / TOEFL as Language certificate. The university website will detail the requirement. Generally you'll need to score higher than **CEFR level B2**

## Formulate Statement of Purpose ü§•
SOP is extremely crucial to the admission process. It could decide whether you make into the programme or not. And since it's a subjective requirement, do spend a lot of time refining your SOP. You can refer the following links to get the idea on how to write an SOP
1. [Structure is Magic Guide to graduate SOP](http://writeivy.com/structure-is-magic-a-guide-to-the-graduate-sop/)
2. [How to write Computer Science SOP](https://writeivy.com/how-to-write-your-computer-science-statement-of-purpose/)
3. [DAAD - advice for motivation letter](https://www2.daad.de/medien/deutschland/stipendien/formulare/advice-for-motivation-letter.pdf)

**Tip:** Get your SOP reviewed on Reddit. There's a [subreddit for just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/StatementOfPurpose/)

## Apply to Universities ahead of deadlines üìÖ
Deadlines are important! So get your documents ready and apply way before the last date.

There are basically 2 ways that universities accept applications:
1. **Direct Application:** This differs from uni to uni, so follow the instructions on their website. Most probably you'll need to send physical documents to the university (probably even notarized).
2. **Through Uni-Assist:** This is easy! [Uni Assist](https://my.uni-assist.de/) is an intermediary and makes the application process easier. With uni-assist, we only need to send the documents once, and uni assist will verify and forward them to all universities that accept applications through uni-assist. You can read the [checklist here](https://www.uni-assist.de/tools/checklisten/)

**Tip:** If you use DHL for sending your documents, ask them about any student offer or discount. 

**Note:** Any application that is forwarded through uni-assist needs to reach uni-assist by the deadline mentioned in university website. **Eg:** If the deadline is 31 October, your hard copies need to reach uni assist by that date.

## Take a deep breath üò§ü´Å and wait for the acceptance letter
If you haven't been in a relationship, this is going to be the most challenging test of your patience. Terrible jokes aside, it's gonna take a while for universities to review your application (along with so many others) and respond. Some universities might have an entrance exam, in which case you will hear from them sooner.

## Open a blocked account, take public health insurance, and take travel insurance üí∞‚úàÔ∏è
The moment you get a positive response from one of the universities that you applied to, start thinking about getting the German Visa. And the first step is to create a blocked account. Blocked accounts are important as a proof of financing your study in Germany, and it's important for your visa approval. 

Here are some blogs / articles on blocked accounts:
1. [Which is the Best Blocked Account in Germany? [2021 English Guide] (simplegermany.com)](https://www.simplegermany.com/best-blocked-account-germany/)
2. [Comparison of Blocked Account packages - DeGiS - degis.info](https://www.degis.info/blocked-account/comparison-blocked-account-packages/)
3. [Blocked Account Germany - 2021 Review | Banks Germany (banks-germany.com)](https://banks-germany.com/blocked-account-germany#what-is-a-blocked-account)

I had taken the Expatrio Value package, which includes a **blocked account**, TK public **health insurance**, and **incoming (travel) insurance**, **all 3 of which are important for your visa application**. There are other package options such as Fintiba. Please check the above blogs, or Google more to see what suits you the best!


## Submit all docs and pay the relevant fees at VFS / Consulate ‚úÖ
Now this part may seem to be the most demanding, and you're not wrong! But don't sweat it, it's just gonna get more challenging from here!  

[Here you can download the checklist](https://india.diplo.de/blob/1862506/802672af6cafefeb9c1ebf3d4568cf88/student-data.pdf) of the documents needed for German student visa application. Alternatively, you can just google 'German Student Visa checklist'

Here's the checklist:
* Valid passport (take photocopies of the front and address page)
* Fill out the main [application form](https://videx-national.diplo.de/videx/visum-erfassung/#/videx-langfristiger-aufenthalt) and take printout of the same

[Here's a guide](https://edubao.azurewebsites.net/blog/how-to-fill-in-the-german-visa-application-form-2020/) on how to fill, in case you've got doubts.

*  Fill out the additional declaration (fyi, this wasn't really useful at VFS kochi. They gave me another declaration form)
*  Statement of Purpose / Letter of Motivation. Yeah, this thing is back, and it needs to be different from the SOP you did while applying to uni. Earlier it was about why you deserve to be admitted into the uni, now it's more of why you deserve to move to Germany üò¨.  
*  Cover Letter
*  Proof of admission into the university
*  IELTS / German Language certificate
*  Resume / CV
*  Academic Certificates
*  Proof of opening Blocked Account
*  Proof of public health insurance
*  Proof of travel insurance
*  Biometric photos. You can find the [specifications here](https://www.germany-visa.org/visa-photo-requirements/)

## Learn the German language and meditate while awaiting a response üè´
If you haven't already, learn the German language. Some good free courses for beginners:
1. GermanPod101
2. Duolingo
3. Wunderbla (free for a month)

## Fly away! ‚úàÔ∏è
