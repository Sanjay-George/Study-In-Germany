## Find the courses / universities
* Search programmes at [DAAD](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/result/)
* Add relevant filters - Course Type, Field of Study, Course Language, etc.
* For each programme, visit the university's website to understand the application deadlines, fees, programme structure, course requirements. 

**Tip:** Initially, create a list of universities or programmes you like. Then go through them again and shorten it based on your interest. Do 2-3 rounds of shortlisting and then prepare for the requirements of those courses.

**Note:** Some programmes have no tuition fees, but only semester fees (approx Euro 300 per sem). Some courses need LORs from your previous uni or work place, so check if this is feasible for you.


## Apply to student dorms
* Google Studentenwerk <cityName> and apply for a room as early as possible. 

**Tip:** Getting an accommodation is extremely difficult in certain cities, the wait times could be as long as 2 semesters (a year!). Better to apply early and cancel later if you aren't goinig there.
